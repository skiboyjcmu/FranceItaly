  - Access to Chamonix Ski areas
    - Brevant & Flegere
      - Brevent is easiest to walk to from the Midi, though up a hill and no lodge at the base gondola so go in ski boots :) The bus stops there too, but looked crowded. There is a train stop very close to Flegere so may be easiest to hop on there. 
      - stayed right next to the Cham Sud train stop, but hardly took it because the train would sit at Cham Centre for like 30m. So check the schedule, the train may be very convenient if you’re closes to Cham Centre. 
      - Between the two mountains there is a gondola, easy to ski both
    - Grant Montets (highest and biggest)
      - take the Train from Cham Centre north to the Grand Montets stop, very easy

#### Resturants
  - Most restaurants do two seatings per night, one at 7pm and one at 9:30pm. Kind of a pain. We found it very hard to walk in anywhere. 
  - There are a few supermarkets - they all seemed ok, we went to prob the most expensive “casino” on the rue du Dr. Paccard
  - Visited
    - Ristorante Chiecco (coeurmayeur) - lunch spot if we go to italy. Bad service but delicious food, extensive wine list 
    - Casa Valerio, 7pm (very good pasta and pizza!)
    - Le Monchu, 7ppl @7pm. (skipped but plan to be hungry for raclette/fondue)
    - Le Cap Horn 7pm + Les Caves for live music/party! (Very fun!)
    - Annapurna (on the main street) - very good indian and good service 
    - Hydromel - SKIP 
    - Le pain de tradition - on the Avenue Aiguille Midi - stop for coffee/croissant before the midi, or grab sandwiches (delicious but sometimes limited selection depending on what time in the morning)
  - On the List:
    - Canailles - dinner. Res for 6 max online, closed Monday and Sunday. 
    - Le Comptoir du vin sur vin (apres)
    - Elevation 1904 - apres/burgers/beers

    - Mumma - hip, bustling dinner in Cham centre. Call between 3:30-6:30pm for reservations (1 week out) or some walk in spaces **Wish we went here!!**
    - Granges d’en Haut (La Table des Granges) - dinner or lunch, res needed in Les Houches. Looks nice but would be a drive away
    - The Wine Factory - apres? in Les Houches
    - Le Bivouac - traditional french, old school climbers spot


#### ETC
  - The [farmers market on Saturday am](https://www.seechamonix.com/events/saturday-market-main-town-689085) at the north side of town was very nice!
  - The Rue du Dr. Paccard is a pedestrian street that runs north/south, lots of shops and restaurants all along it and its a nice stroll
  - There is a great mid-mtn restaurant under the triple at Flegere - check it out!!
  - The glacier exhibit/tunnel at the bottom of the Vallee Blanche was very cool, worth taking a few mins to check it out (not sure it’s worth taking the train/gondola straight there but ppl did. It’s about 500 steps down from the gondola to the foot of the glacier)
  - Geneva/Paris airport is a disaster with the strikes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND AIR TAGS FOR LUGGAGE!! My ski bag was 36h late. There is a good shop right next to the Midi with a decent demo fleet if you’re in need :)
