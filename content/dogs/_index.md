#### LATELY, they've been stealing food from counters.  Do not leave any food unattended on the counter/table for even a few mins.  Put your dinner in the microwave if you need to step away for a few mins.
  

- Daycare: 
  - Seattle/SoDo: https://seattledogresort.com/reservation/ We have a pre-paid block of days, so just call ahead and make sure they have space
  - North Bend: https://outonaleash.com/home.  This is where they go on a regular basis.  Call ahead and make sure they have space, and they only take Cash. 
- Walking - try to make them sit before opening door and going outside. This helps him to calm down ahead of the walk. When they’re sitting and  paying attn “all right come” and then lead them outside (hopefully without jumping)
  - Don’t let king pull you around. Firm tug, or “Heel” or “tsssst” noise to get him to stop pulling. (This hasn't really been a problem lately)
  
- CBD - If King or Nova is going nuts, feel free to give him 1 CBD treat from same drawer next to front door
- Gates - If you’re going to leave them at home (totally fine) keep them on the lower level with doors closed to upstairs
  - There is a gate on the back deck if it's nice out but you don't want them getting too dirty/digging
  - Back yard is fine to go poo.  Try to pickup poos every couple days so it's not all over backyard (don't have to be militant about it)
    - Don't leave them unattended back there for more than an hour.  They tend to dig, and while not a concern for the lawn, they do end up dirty

- Sleeping - sheets are clean on both beds. Nova usually gets up first for a goodnight snuggle and then gets off.  King is a lump and may try to sleep all over you
- They both kinda like having water bowl full on bathroom floor overnight (otherwise you may wake up to them dragging it across the floor to fill it)
- Food - same for both of them. 1 not-all-the-way-full scoop each 2x a day.
  - add 1 capsule of probiotic to each dogs food in the morning.  best to seperate the capsule and sprinkle the power on food
  - King has a purple/green wobble we give him dinner in a few times a week.  Unscrew the yellow cap and put food into there (it takes awhile b/c the hole is small)
- Bathroom - if either of them are scratching at any door, they probably have to go out (within reason...just make sure they aren’t playing you!! )
 
### House -
  - We have Amazon Alexa Dots all over the place. They control mostly lights and fans
  - Feel free to eat or drink anything.
  - If it’s warm, best to leave a bunch of windows open with shades cracked (to let air flow but not too much sunlight in).  Fans throughout the house as needed, and they can be left on full time so it doesn’t get too hot during the day 
    - Entry Fan
    - Master Bedroom Fan
    - Living Room Fan
  - Trash day is Tuesday, so put trash, food waste OR recycling out on Mon  night.  Food waste and recycling alternate weeks
  - The small metal trash can in front of garage is for dog poo bags during the week, throw that in the main garbage bag on Mon night.  There are a bunch of bags for that metal can just inside garage door
  - We have security cameras outside in front and back of house 
  - Feel free to take the dogs any/everywhere.  There’s a seat cover in garage if you need it. They do fine in the trunk if you have a hatchback, or use the seat cover for back seat.
  - If you leave the dogs at home (totally fine for up to 10 hours), 
  - Roomba vacuums
    - they run generally during the day.  If you don't see them in their cradle in the evening/morning, go find them and put them back (they probably got stuck)
  - Espressor machine
    - water in top left
    - whole bean coffee in top right
    - espresso shot/+ water on left buttons
    - latte/cappuccino on right buttons
      - must have milk carafe installed, and put it back in fridge when done
    - Empty water and grounds when machine indicated necessary
  - Regular coffee maker and grinder in pantry 

  ### Daily Schedule-
  - Sometime between 7-9am - walk both dogs or let let them outside in back yard to do business 
  - Towels to dry/wipe off feet at the upstairs slider window and in the laundry room
    - More towels in bedroom level hall closet if they get soaked
  - Breakfast/while you’re eating/making coffee/etc - 
  - Nova is a finicky eater so she might not finish her food.  King will devour his
  - ~3-5PM Afternoon walk/let out in back yard
  - Playtime options- as long as it’s not raining, we try have them them outside to play offleash at least 30 mins during the day
    - Back yard
    - in the river.  
      - Directly behind out house is pretty shallow
      - 500 yards to the right, down pathway, there is a deeper pool where the river bends.  Paths upstream at start of this area, and downstream at the end, and either is fine to go into
      - There is an off leash dog park https://www.snoqualmiewa.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Three-Forks-OffLeash-Dog-Park-66 abouut 10 min away by car.
    - Generally, they will be less of a handful at night/while you're at the house if they've had walks/playtime/rivertime/etc during the day.

  ### Misc
  - They’re both super friendly towards people and other dogs. 
  - Treats are OK pretty much anytime as rewards or generally whenever.  Often helpful  to get them back inside or come to you if they’re being stubborn.  
  - They both know 
    - sit (open palm facing upwards).
    - Shake - offer them a hand to shake
    - High 5 - literally human high 5
    - Down (point to and/or touch ground)
    - Hug (stand up, arms at your sides, open palms up) - this is the only time we let them jump up on us. 
  - Leashes loop over their head and buckle under their belly with the leash facing forward.  It helps to keep them from pulling too hard 
  - Kingsley’s left eye is a bit puffy/droopy/red around the outside edge.  Occasionally you’ll catch the redness and it looks worrisome, but as you keep investigating it’s not that bad.  We asked the vet and they said it’s fine as long as he’s not itching/scratching, and generally he doesn’t notice it. 
  - Try to make sure there’s always water in the bowl, but don’t stress over it.  If they makes a mess with it, so there’s a mop on the wall in panrty if needed
  - If there is an accident (you’ll probably notice it much later), don’t worry too much about it.  Soak up as much as possible with paper towels and spray some of the natures miracle on it.  If you remember, come back 15 mins later and try to dry again with paper towels, but it’s not a big deal.  
    - There is a wet vac in the furnace room.  If it's a poo accident, and you get it right away, this is prob the best bet
