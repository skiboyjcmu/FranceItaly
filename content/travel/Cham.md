  - Access to Chamonix Ski areas
    - Brevant & Flegere
      - Brevent is easiest to walk to from the Midi, though up a hill and no lodge at the base gondola so go in ski boots :) The bus stops there too, but looked crowded. There is a train stop very close to Flegere so may be easiest to hop on there. 
      - stayed right next to the Cham Sud train stop, but hardly took it because the train would sit at Cham Centre for like 30m. So check the schedule, the train may be very convenient if you’re closes to Cham Centre. 
      - Between the two mountains there is a gondola, easy to ski both
      - Knock your sox off fancy lunch Brevant (oysters and grilled pork :): https://www.restaurants-altitude.com/en/restaurants/la-bergerie-de-plan-praz/

  - [Private Chef & Grocery Delivery](https://www.privatecateringchamonix.com)
  - The [farmers market on Saturday am](https://www.seechamonix.com/events/saturday-market-main-town-689085) at the north side of town was very nice!
  - The Rue du Dr. Paccard is a pedestrian street that runs north/south, lots of shops and restaurants all along it and its a nice stroll
  -
  - The glacier exhibit/tunnel at the bottom of the Vallee Blanche was very cool, worth taking a few mins to check it out (not sure it’s worth taking the train/gondola straight there but ppl did. It’s about 500 steps down from the gondola to the foot of the glacier)
  - Geneva/Paris airport is a disaster with the strikes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND AIR TAGS FOR LUGGAGE!! There is a good shop right next to the Midi with a decent demo fleet if you’re in need :)
